## Ocean Health Index: CW Nutrient Plumes 

This data layer is prepped within the watershed_PO4eq_prep and the /plumes folder. 

First you must create a pourpoint file, which is done in the first half of the data prep `watershed_PO4eq_prep`, and then use that prepped pourpoint file to feed into the plume model. The steps to run the plume model are outlined in the README in the /plumes folder.
